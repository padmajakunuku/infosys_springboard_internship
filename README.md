# Infosys_Edu2Job: Predicting Job Roles from Educational Background

## Overview
Infosys_Edu2Job is a machine learning project aimed at predicting job roles based on a candidate's educational background, skills, and certifications. This project helps in automating the process of job role recommendation by analyzing candidate data and predicting suitable roles.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib  

## Dataset
The dataset contains candidate information with features such as:
- Education
- Skills
- Certifications
- Job Roles  

It is used to train machine learning models to predict the most suitable job role for a given candidate.

## Workflow & Features
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understand data distribution and patterns.  
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale features.  
3. **Model Building:** Train machine learning models to predict job roles.  
4. **Evaluation:** Assess model performance using appropriate metrics.  
5. **Visualization:** Generate graphs and charts to better understand data and model predictions.  

## Contribution
- Performed EDA and data preprocessing.  
- Built and evaluated machine learning models for predicting job roles.  
- Visualized insights to improve understanding of candidate-job relationships.

## Future Work
- Improve prediction accuracy using advanced models and hyperparameter tuning.  
- Incorporate additional features such as work experience or certifications duration.  
- Deploy as a web application for real-time job role recommendations.
